To use:
1) Extract guitar_samples.7z001,002,003.
2) Install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt
3) Run gtss_main.py to launch GTSS.
4) Go into the Configure menu and change the default keyswitches to whatever your sample library uses. You shouldn't need to change the other settings unless you want to mess around (this only needs to be done once.)
5) After that, hit OK, load up your midi, select the instruments you want to render from your midi, and start rendering!
